ESP32 and PZEM-004T Energy Monitor for Home Assistant

This repository contains the source code (firmware) to build a DIY electricity consumption monitor. It uses an ESP32 microcontroller to read measurements from a PZEM-004T v3.0 sensor and sends them to an MQTT broker, allowing seamless integration with Home Assistant and its energy dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration (Configuraci√≥n)

Before compiling and uploading the firmware, you must modify the code to include your own credentials in the following lines:

```cpp
// Your WiFi network configuration
const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";

// Your MQTT Broker configuration
const char* mqtt_server = "YOUR_BROKER_IP"; // E.g.: "192.168.1.100"
const int mqtt_port = 1883;
const char* mqtt_user = "YOUR_MQTT_USERNAME";
const char* mqtt_pass = "YOUR_MQTT_PASSWORD";
```
